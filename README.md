# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

* As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily log, so that I can manage my work hours efficently and effectively. 

## Description

* A web application was built so that a user may add or alter important work day tasks in a daily log. The daily log indicates whether the task is being placed in the past, present, or future of the current time. Tasks are saved to the daily log even if the user refreshes the page, so the user may refer back to it.

## Codebase Criteria

* It is done when the current day is displayed at the top of the daily log. 

* It is done when there are time block displayed for standard buisness hours. 

* It is done when the time blocks are color coded to indicate past, present and future. 

* It is done when the user is able to click a time block and enter an event. 

* It is done when the user is able to save the event in local storage. 

* It is done when the event persists even if the page is refreshed.
